* Consider ways of separating JSON read/write functions from data-centric TagMap container.
* Document all classes, functions, fields, etc.
* Update root CMakeLists to build only required configuration of wxWidgets.
* Decide how consistently it's appropriate to say "registered" in accessors for registered tags.
* Where appropriate, consider replacing std::pair with explicit struct.
* Where appropriate, consider replacing bool with explicit enum.
* Use std::map::max_size() in relevant functions that check capacity.
* Define JSON labels ("id", "tag", etc.) as constants rather than using them as magic strings.
* Add appropriate licenses.
