* Consider ways of separating JSON read/write functions from data-centric TagMap container.
* Document all classes, functions, fields, etc.
* Update root CMakeLists to build only required configuration of wxWidgets.
* Decide how consistently it's appropriate to say "registered" in accessors for registered tags.
* Where appropriate, consider replacing std::pair with explicit struct.
* Where appropriate, consider replacing bool with explicit enum.
* Use std::map::max_size() in relevant functions that check capacity.
* Define JSON labels ("id", "tag", etc.) as constants rather than using them as magic strings.
* Add appropriate licenses.
* Make sure we add functions setting and retrieving TagProperties.
* Revisit the confusing matter of how to link libraries for wxWidgets. I don't think that including
  them one-by-one is the intended use, but I struggled for hours in vain to find the "right" way.
* Add coverage checks.
* Update addFile() to validate FileProperties for registered tags... Or else, modify the interface.
* Implement a setTags() function that can set multiple tags on a file at once?
* Handle exclusive settings radio-button style where setting one clears another?
* Perhaps I should automatically consider a tag UNCOMMITTED when missing from a file.
* Resolve Catch2 debug issue (PDB warnings upon build).
* Add ability to drag tags around.
* Figure out how to configure startup project via CMake such that I can simply F5 from VS to build
  and execute RagTag.exe without needing to modify solution settings.
* Allow more granularity in communicating ofstream/ifstream errors in TagMap to/from file ops.
* Reduce duplicated code within OnNew(), OnOpen().
* Add a fileDeclaresTag() into the TagMap API, which would spare the developer the need to look up
  the file, look up the file's tags, search the file's tags for the tag in question, etc. And after
  doing this, replace the logic within refreshTagToggles() to make use of this new function.
* For debugging purposes, create backup files when saving. (Maybe this would be in production too?)
* What would be the best way to store information about the order of tags in the UI, theoretical
  colors assigned to each tag, etc.? If this were to end up in the tagdef JSON, it would transform
  it from a utilitarian, data-centric structure to something more frontend-oriented, but if we
  were to maintain separate files, then there would be tight links the two that the utility would
  have to maintain. This too doesn't seem like good design.
* Figure out why last tag gets smooshed when redrawing when the list occupies the visible extents
  of the panel.
* Get serious about versioning the protocol of the JSON file representing the TagMap.

When resuming debug log efforts, use this code:
```
    // TODO: DEBUG
    const wxString debug_media_dir = wxStandardPaths::Get().GetDocumentsDir() + "/ragtag-debug/";
    wxFFileOutputStream output(debug_media_dir + "debug.txt");
    wxTextOutputStream log(output);
```
